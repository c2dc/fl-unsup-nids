# Generalizing intrusion detection for heterogeneous networks: A stacked-unsupervised federated learning approach

This repository relates to our paper that describes the stacked-unsupervised federated learning (FL) approach to generalize on a cross-silo configuration for a flow-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The proposed approach we have examined comprises a deep autoencoder in conjunction with an energy flow classifier in an ensemble learning task. 

Our approach performs better than traditional local learning and naive cross-evaluation (training in one context and testing on another network data). Remarkably, the proposed approach demonstrates a sound performance in the case of non-iid data silos. In conjunction with an informative feature in an ensemble architecture for unsupervised learning, we advise that the proposed FL-based NIDS results in a feasible approach for generalization between heterogeneous networks.

# Reproducing this work
Install the requirements to reproduce this work:

- Tested with Python 3.9.11

```commandline
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv\bin\activate
(venv) $ pip install --upgrade pip
(venv) $ pip install Cython
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Some possible configurations
- To simulate other federated learning strategies of aggregation, the changes must be made to `server.py` according to [Flower documentation](https://flower.dev/docs/strategies.html).
- To remove the EFC as part of the autoencoder, remove the argument `--with-EFC` from the shellscript files.
- Select between `just benign` or `benign and attack` threshold for the autoencoder. Edit the file `client.py`, the `test_eval` assigned to `distance_calc` method refers to both thresholds, and assigned to the comparison of `losses` to `threshold_benign` for the only benign case.
