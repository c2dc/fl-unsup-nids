# Full Datasets

The source for the full datasets made up of 43 extended NetFlow features is:

To reproduce this work, download the 4 datasets (NF-UNSW-NB15-v2, NF-ToN-IoT-v2, NF-BoT-IoT-v2, NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018-v2) and compress them with Gzip, because the scripts reads files with the extension `*.csv.gz`.
